github repository assignment
repository containing first github attempt, using small mammal data from a previous assignment to mimic really using this platform, used the github practice we did in class as a basis for this and modified it to meet requirements for assignment.
so far the most challenging thing has been github, but I have a feeling R will give me trouble until I really remember how to use it
